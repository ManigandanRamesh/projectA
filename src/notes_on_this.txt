// this.title=title; 
// this.title is global variable ,and title is a local variable.
title=filmtitle;
 // This is similar to this.title=filmtitle,but using this.prefix is not compulsory
director=filmdirector; 
// This is similar to this.director=filmdirector,but using this.prefix is not compulsory.
// as there are no local variables by name ,title or director so,
//                              here they wil implicitly referred to global variable.
// Note: if title and director are not globally declare then it will be undeclred variable cannot be resolved to a variable.
// if the parameter names are similar to the global variable.
// then there is an ambiquity between the local variable(parameters)and global variable
// hence this.prefix is used for reffering the global variable
// title=title will be referring the local variable on both side of the = operator (x=x) self assigning.
